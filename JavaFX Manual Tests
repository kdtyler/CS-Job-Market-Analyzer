JavaFX Manual Tests

Description: This file will go over some of the basic tests that were done to test the GUI, as the GUI class is difficult to use
JUnit tests on.

Job Market Analyzer Window (Starting window)
- State, Experience, and Distance windows have all determined options, and a default value is set
- Every radio button for Type can be clicked, and default is set to full-time
- The textfields for Job Title, Estimated Salary, and City all allow for extra text if a string input is very long
- Job Title, Estimated Salary, and City can all be left blank and code will run (though not recommended, because search results and thus
scraping will be very, very long).

Output Window (Results window)
- All text contained inside window in both x and y direction
- Output is based on the user-input
- Can interact with input window while output window still open (intended functionality)
